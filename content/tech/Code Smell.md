# Code Smell

Code smells are things in a codebase that readily stick out and imply something may be off with how it has been designed. Code smells are indicators of problems that can be addressed during refactoring. Code smells are easy to spot and fix, but they may be just symptoms of a deeper problem with code. Let's go through different kind of code smells.
